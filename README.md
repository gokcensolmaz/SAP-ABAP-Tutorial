# SAP-ABAP-Tutorial

This repository contains the code and projects I have worked on during my internship, where I am learning SAP and ABAP.
The primary learning resource I've been using is [Burak Kocaaslan's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BurakKocaaslan).


You can find the image of the table I used in the ZEGS_SAMPLE05 file below.

You can find simple examples of structures such as data types, functions, methods and classes mentioned in the ABAP Tutorial in the ZEGS_SAMPLE05 and ZEGS_SAMPLE06 files.
